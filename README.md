Summary:

The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

Foreword:

The cis-3-Hexen-1-ol, also known as (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and leaf alcohol, is a colorless oily liquid with an intense grassy-green odor of freshly cut green grass and leaves.
It is produced in small amounts by most plants and it acts as an attractant to many predatory insects. cis-3-Hexen-1-ol is a very important aroma compound that is used in fruit and vegetable flavors and in perfumes.
The yearly production is about 30 tonnes.

# Clone
Open a terminal and run following command:
```
git clone <repository url>
```
# Instalation
Then go to created repository and run following command:
```
make
```
# Run
After insatalation run following command:
```
./pipex <infile> <cmd1> <cmd2> <outfile>
```
The execution of the pipex program should do the same as the next shell command:
```
$> file1 < cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
```
